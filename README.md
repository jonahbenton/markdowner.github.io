Markdown, Humanized
===================

**A More Pleasant Way to Print & View Markdown.**

The site is now live [here](http://markdowner.github.io)!

This site is an afternoon hack to fill a need of my own: the ability to print and view markdown in a appealing and typographically tasteful manner. This isn’t something most markdown apps are good at.

## What’s on the Roadmap
[ ] Print button on preview  
[ ] Save button on preview  
[ ] Save data to localstorage; make it persistent for 30 mins  
[ ] Input a gist id to get markdown from (or append gist id to url)    
[ ] Upload markdown file   
[ ] Night mode   
[ ] PDF/ODT exporting
[ ] User specified font/color/size
