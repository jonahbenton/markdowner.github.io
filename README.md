Markdown, Humanized
===================

**A More Pleasant Way to Print & View Markdown.**

The site is now live [here](http://markdowner.github.io)!

This site is an afternoon hack to fill a need of my own: the ability to print and view markdown in a appealing and typographically tasteful manner. This isnâ€™t something most markdown apps are good at.

**Take a look at TODO.md to see where this project is headed.**
